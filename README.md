binary LED clock

it should work... at least i last remember it working... working with a few issues (it's upside down oops!)

also it is worth noting that this repo has additional files that have nothing to do with this project, but rather it was my practice lolz

hardware used: (maybe ill update this later idk) some random arduino kit i found at home i think
